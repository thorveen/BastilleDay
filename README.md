# BastilleDay
A repository created on Bastille Day, to commemorate the data management revolution.


Hey look, it's possible to edit the READMe file. might be a good place to keep a running set of notes.

Troubleshooting on 14 July 2015

1) At ~10am, Yoel created the Repo "Bastille Day." He created the Repo on GitHub, then created a new project in Rstudio through File-->New Project --> Version Control and HTTPS. Then I added local repository in Git App.

2) In R Studio, I created an R script titled "LetThemEatCake" and saved it. I committed it in RStudio, and pushed it through GitApp. At this stage, there are no forks or branches.

3) In GitHub, I added Thor as a collaborathor to the Bastille Day Repo.

4) Thor has forked the repo.

5) Change made from the clone on my laptop.
